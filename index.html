  <h2> GRAPHIC DESIGN</h2><br>
    <p><h2>Graphic design is the art of creating and arranging visual elements to communicate a message effectively.</h2>

      <p>  While the term “graphic design” was coined in the 1920s, the art form itself has long been an essential part of visual communication.<br>
         Early examples of graphic design can be seen in ancient manuscripts and even prehistoric cave paintings.</h2><br></p>
        
        <p>Today, the graphic design industry spans many different disciplines and specializations. It's an exciting field that’s constantly evolving.<br>
             Yet, its adaptive nature can make it hard to understand exactly what graphic design is and what types of work graphic designers do.<br>
          In this article, we’ll cover what graphic design is, examples of different types, and how each design job differs.</p>
        
    <p><h2>What is graphic design?</h2></p>
        Graphic design is the art of composing visual elements such as typography, images, colors, and shapes to communicate information or convey a message effectively.<br>
         Designing the layout of a magazine, creating a poster for a theatre performance, and designing packaging for a product are all examples of graphic design.<br>
        <p>In fact, almost everyone today practices some form of graphic design in their daily life whether it’s adding text to an image for social media or color coding a spreadsheet for work.<br>
         Basically, if you’re creating visual content, you’re practicing some form of graphic design.<br></p>
        
        <p><h2> What is the main purpose of graphic design?</h2></p>
        The objective of graphic design is to convey or enhance a message.
        Good graphic art streamlines communication. Picture a spreadsheet with data analytics.<br>
         A graphic designer might use different colors to highlight which metrics are rising and which are dropping, making it easier for the viewer to quickly understand what’s going well and what they need to adjust.<br>
        Well-executed graphic design can also elicit an emotional response from the viewer or even motivate them to take action.<br>
         <p>The “sign up” page on a website, for example, typically entices visitors to join an email list or start a free trial. Meanwhile, food packaging design aims to make the food inside seem more appealing to eat. </p>
        
        <p><h2>What does a graphic designer do?</h2></p>
        As visual communicators of ideas, information, and messages, graphic designers use their artistic skills and technical expertise to undertake a variety of tasks and responsibilities,<br>
         depending on the specific role or project they’re working on. 
        
        A graphic designer’s responsibilities range from brand and visual identity design to marketing design and advertising, web design, illustration, type design, infographic design, textile and surface design, packaging design, editorial or publication design, motion graphic design, and user interface design.<br>
        <p> Each of these aspects requires visual communication and team collaboration from graphic designers. 
        
        Visual communication is the foundation of graphic design, and it's the first step for each project you’ll take on. Graphic designers start this step by working alongside their client, department, or team to understand the project, its background, audience, goals, and other items provided by the client and/or brief. What follows is a collaborative brainstorm of ideas and visual concepts until it’s time to start the design, layout, and composition. .</p>
